# Overview

In honor of Frederick Douglass' 200th birthday, we will analyze and encode examples from the [Colored Conventions project](Colored). 

This is a monthly meet-up group interested in developing an understanding of transcription and encoding standards using the TEI XML-based schema. Those interested in using other schemas, such as the MEI, are also welcome to participate. Currently, we are uploading all of our learning docs and texts into the [TAPAS Project](TAPAS), where you can immediately render and view your files. We encourage you to bring a text or document that you are interested in transcribing and encoding. Please bring a laptop that has a text editor (Oxygen XML Editor or Atom) installed.
